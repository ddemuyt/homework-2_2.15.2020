# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description
This project is a combination of basic HTML code, accompanied by Twitter Bootstrap and a small external CSS file. 
I worked to develop a baseline profile, consisting of an About Me, Porfolio, and Contact sections. 
Each section was developed with HTML formatting and Bootstrap templates in order to improve efficency and design.

The purpose of this project was to showcase some of the Bootstrap elements (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) easily accessible to deploy in everyday code. 
Searching through Bootstraps library of contents and grid system allowed me to create a responsive design between mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop users. 
Bootstrap heavily uses the <i>class</i> elements to grab designs from a massive open-source library. These open sources allow any individual to apply, bend, and customize pre-made templates for improved design.

Each of my pages have a navbar, footer, and elements of the Bootstrap grid system.

With the use of the grid system, I was able to design a fluid and responsive site. By defining the 12 columns within each row in each container, you have full control of what goes where and when.
The About Me section, I divided the profile picture from the descriptive text and designed it so the picture was responsive to the screen size.
The Porfolio has several images defines for screen size, with badges responding to their relative position.
The Contact page is a card template with a few added elements from Bootstrap's form components.
All three of these pages are linked through <i>href</i> channels, allowing the user to shift from one page to another quickly and easily.

Overall, this project takes many front-end design elements and combines them with the Bootstrap OSC. This makes for a high quality product with limited time, resources, or inherit talent. It also creates an optimal site for most users for the resources used to create it.
